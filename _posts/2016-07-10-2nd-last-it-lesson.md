What I learned in my lesson

In my lesson in Monday I learned what some of the consequences of sexting and revenge porn and how they can affect you. For example if you show naked picture of your girlfriend after you have broken up then the girl might get bullied at school and attempt and maybe succeed at Suicide, and the father or fathers friend might come round to your house and beat you up - even after what the police have done. If you sext, and you are under the age limit then you might ruin your entire career as it will go down on your record and if you then try and get a job later in life the company won't employ you as you have been prosecuted for sexting.
