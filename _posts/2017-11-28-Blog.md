Recently we have stopped doing google sheets with Mr. Tansley and have moved on to repl.it. This is a site where we can type in coding and make sentences in a bar on the right. We used repl.it in yr8 (last year), but it is all just coming back to me and how to use coding correctly. At first I had a little bit of confusion on what we would be doing and how to use code to complete my task but overall i know feel comfortable with coding on repl.it. I felt happy with how to make text appear and responses, from the Ai. My homework was to add in 3 more questions with responses and i managed to complete that task relatively quickly.
