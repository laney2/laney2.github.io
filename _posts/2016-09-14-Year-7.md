Year 7

In year 7 with Mr Keen we learned about scratch coding, online safety, media literacy. Microbit coding, and we did a 'my identity' poster.  What I found difficult was the scratch and microbit codings, because it was very confusing most of the time. What I found easy was media literacy and online safety as I understood what I was being told and what tasks we had to do. When we were learning about online safety I knew about what was allowed on the internet and what i shouldn’t put on there because it could get me prosecuted or in a lot of trouble, also what I learned about what to put on is that you should of put things on the internet that you would show to your grandparents. A target i would set myself for the future would be to make sure I understand what I am doing so that if we get homework i won’t get a detention for not doing my work.
