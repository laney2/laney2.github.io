Worksheet 5

 ["Batman", "Wonder Woman", "Superman", "Spiderman"]

print("Current pilot: ", heroes[0])

heroes[2] = "Hit Girl"

heroes.append("Captain America")

heroes.append("Deadpool")

print(heroes)

Replace = input("What hero do you want to replace? (0-5)") 

New = input("Who replaces them?") 

heroes[int(Replace)] = str(New)

print(heroes)

We started doing some more coding, and a worksheet on superheros I feel like I did these worksheets well and understand coding more. Although i did trip up a bit as i've forgotten lots of code since, Year 8. We have also been doing worksheets on lists, functions and loops all with a scenario in which you must use to solve the problem.  The task was "to keep the superheros files up to date".
