Social media 

Over the past few weeks I have learnt many things about social media.In the last 6 lessons when we have learnt about social media it has changed the way I have used social media, because I now know that I shouldn't post anything that I wouldn’t want my teachers,parents and family seeing - which means I wouldn’t post any rude things or innapropiate (naked pictures of mysef, etc). The changes that I would like to make (based on the activity) would be who I am following?, why I am I following that person? Do I know who they are? and have they copied any of my embarrassing pictures? My Identity map helped me decide what would be acceptable to put on social media, what is ok to put more of on social media and what i shouldn’t put on social media or less of on social media. This process felt different to what I would post online as I was sharing it with my class and the people I know and if I did it on social media and posted something like my adress, email or phone numbers. When I read through the comments It wasn’t a surprise that lots of people commented on the football club I support, It was a bit of a surprise when people were saying things like your handwriting wasn’t neat and things like that. When I read through the comments I felt quite happy as their was a few complements. I prefered that we went round the room and commented rather than doing it in front of the class with people asking questions directly at me as it would be quite pressuring because lots of people staring at me would make me lose my confidence. It felt good commenting on the identity maps as you got to look at the maps and see what other people did. I felt good about sharing my identity map in that way as it wasn’t embarrassing and their wasn’t anything embarrassing on it. When I created my identity map it felt good as I was putting what my personality was, on to paper and looking over what I had done made me proud of who I was.
