Propaganda

In my lesson on monday we learned about how adverts can make us want something as a celebrities use them, so it make us think we can do what they are doing when you use this product, also adverts use ordinary people to show that you can do amazing things without being famous, for example, a McDonalds advert had lots of athletes in one of their fast food places, all eating burgers, and 'fatty foods'. This makes you thinks that you can be really good at a sport even if you eat McDonalds. However if you think about it then athletes mostly have healthy diets so they probably don’t eat McDonalds. Also the companies bend statistics to make it seem that it is the best, like if someone said ‘more than 100000 people said it was the best product ever it make you think that a high percentage of people thought it was amazing but then it could have been 100 000 out of 1 000 000.
