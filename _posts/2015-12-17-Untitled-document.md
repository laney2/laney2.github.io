NEW BLOG

On monday In my Ict lesson we changed our github background.What i had found confusing was what things in the coding we actually needed and what things we didn't, what i found really easy was changing my background colour and changing the colour of my writing and changing my writing to a different text style (arial). I also found out how to mix colours. Everyday you learn new things!
