Microbit planning

In my last lesson we were planning our microbit games in pairs. I was with Alex and we were coming up with more ways to make my game better, this - for me - was an easier way of improving my game by sharing thoughts which meant more ideas were drawn to the game which would build it to be a workable game quicker.I found when you actually had to build the game it was difficult and you would have to break all the thoughts down so the computer would be able to process it.
