Fuze box

In the lesson Ethan and I found out  about the editing where we typed in 

''Cycle

"Hello world"

'Repeat'

And then a big list came up that was going really fast down the page. Then we typed in as well 

"wait(1)"

This made the words Hello World be slower so that we could read the words and they weren't all like Hello WorldHello World etc. it left gaps so that it was very easy to read and slower.

I have now learned how to setup a fuze box, do some coding so that it shows up on the screen as what i have typed in and how to make the writing readable
