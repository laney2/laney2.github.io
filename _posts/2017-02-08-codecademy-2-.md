    <td>I managed to complete the level i was stuck on with the help of Mr. Keen. After that i made sure i had read every single word of the instructions and what we were doing. I managed to catch up to my friend who was ahead of me before i started, which i was pleased about.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As i moved on the levels got harder, and harder, however i have noticed that if you read what you are actually doing it gets a lot easier and the instructions don't simply tell you the answer but in the text about what you are doing there is lots of key information about how to do what you need to do.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will again do the same as what i did and then hopefully i will get to 30 - 35% complete on the python coding. 
So far i think that i am understanding the coding a lot more and have realised the methods on what to do.</td>
