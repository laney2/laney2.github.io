In my lesson on monday i learned about how the Mcdonald's ads make their burger look different but they still use the same ingredients. With the ads they use special ways of making the burger still look big and the let you see all the ingredients, with the ketchup they used the same ketchup you would get in the fast food place except they used a syringe to place the ketchup exactly where the wanted it. After they had done making the burger they then got it onto a computer screen where they covered up any holes in the bun and make the cheese look smooth
