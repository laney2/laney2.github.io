Quiz

Very recently we have been doing quizzes and have been tasked to create our own so mine is on "What animal are you!" it is very common, however i struggled to even think of a topic! We have only started to actually code the quizzes and put the logic together but it will be an interesting outcome. 

Options 

* Dog

* Cat

* Lion

* Shark

* Giraffe

    

What characteristics do you have?

1)Playful

2)Lazy

3)Tall

4)Aggressive

5) mysterious

Are you …?

1. Very loud

2. Quite loud

3. Not really heard

4. Quite quiet

5. Very quiet

Do you like to?

1. Play

2. Swim

3. Sleep

4. run

5. eat

Which film do you prefer?

1. The Lion king

2. Jaws

3. Marmaduke

4. Madagascar

5. Horton who hears who

What food do you like?

1. Raw meat

2. Vegetables

3. Peanut butter

4. Cooked meat

The coding behind it so far is:

answer = []

question_list = [["What characteristics do you have?" "a: Playful", "b: Lazy", "c: Tall", "d: Aggressive", "e: mysterious"]["Are you …?" "a: Very loud", "b: Quite loud", "c: Not really heard", "d: Quite quiet", "e: Very quiet"]["Do you like to?" "a: Play" "b: Swim" "c: sleep" "d: run" "e: eat"["Which film do you prefer?" "a: The Lion king" "b: Jaws" "c: Madagascar"]]

 

I think this will be one of the most interesting tasks i will have done and hope that it will work, so i can have my very own working quiz!
