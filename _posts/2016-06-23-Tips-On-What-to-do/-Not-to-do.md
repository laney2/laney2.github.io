Tips On What to do/ Not to do

* Don't do your homework the night before it is due into school.

*  Only post a comment on google classroom if it is sensible, if you have a problem and you have tried to fix it or if you are giving advice/ answering someones question.

* Don't fill up Mr Keen's emails with questions that you could ask a friend or figure out for yourself.

* If you don't understand something in the lesson put up your hand (you might not be the only one)

* Do your homework the day you get it.

* You will have to figure things out for yourself so don't expect your teacher to be sympathetic if you canâ€™t figure something out.
