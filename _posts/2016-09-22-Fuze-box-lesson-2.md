Fuze box 2

In my second lesson on the fuse box Ethan and I (after having a few difficulties with running our program.) learned about how to change the Ink colour, change the colour of the background of the writing and we saved all of this on to Ethan's memory stick, so that we can start what we did in our next lesson. Now our coding looks like:

Cycle

Ink=Black

Paper=Red 

Print "Hello world" ;

Wait(1)

Repeat 

So that it comes up like Hello WorldHello WorldHello World every second.

We also made another thing where it goes like

Girls=10

Boys=10

Class=Boys+Girls

Print Class

20

Girls+5

Print Class 

25

And it would have gone on like 

Boys+5

Print Class 

30.
