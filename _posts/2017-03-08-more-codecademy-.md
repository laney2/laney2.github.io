    <td>As always i get stuck on one question which i read over and over again and still don't understand it, however normally it takes me half the lesson to work it out, but in this week's lesson it only took about 5 - 10 minutes, this shows i am understanding more.
I have now got used to typing with a broken finger and it will not limit my learning any more!</td>
