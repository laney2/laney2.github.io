**In my lesson**

In my lesson we learned about all the advantages and disadvantages  about social media. We also got into groups of â…˜ and worked out what stuff was alright to put on social media and what wasn't. Some of the things that was alright to put on social media was (a funny picture of a cat or people drinking alcohol). Some of the things that was bad to put on social media was the party address you were going to or sending flirty images to other people.
