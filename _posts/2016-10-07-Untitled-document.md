Fuze box 3

In my 3rd lesson of the fuze box Ethan and I were onto an Apples program where we typed in coding, it looked like this:

CLS

Apples=6

Print "We have “; Apples; “Apples"

Print

Print "If we eat one…"

Print

Apples = Apples - 1

END 

This allows us to have variables like numbers in our program and can do Apples = 6, if we eat one Apples = 5
