    <td>On codecademy I got stuck again on a question and it took me while to figure it out, once i has actually finished that question there wasn't enough time to continue with doing another section. I’m now quite far through python coding and i understand how to make strings and 'print’ things like string or my_variable. One thing you must do in order to understand the code is that you read what you are actually doing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on reading the entire section on what i am doing instead of skim reading it and rushing off to do something i don’t understand and get stuck like i have before. Even though i did 5% at home for homework I need to get into the flow of codecademy more, possibly doing 2 questions a day rather than one every day but a few more on wednesday. </td>
