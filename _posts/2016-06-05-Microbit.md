Microbit

Over the last few lessons we have done coding on a website called Microbit. This is a website where you can use coding in blocks then change it to actual coding. This is quite easy as it can give you step by step instructions where you have to find out what code you use. It also tells you when you have made a mistake in your coding. Sometimes it can be difficult as you either make a mistake and you don't know how to solve it or you can’t find the right code to fit in. There is tutorials for the codings but sometimes it doesn’t work so you have to refresh the page which makes it annoying after a while.
