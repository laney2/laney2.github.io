In my last lesson before half-term

In my lesson before half-term we learned about how our identity can be changed when we were online. We were also creating part of our identity map which shows what sort of stuff we have in our identity. We  found out that lots of people change their identity about who they are.What I found easy was that I could write about my identity very easily. What I found hard was when we were talking about what users change their identity and why.
