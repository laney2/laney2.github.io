New Term lesson 1

A new term has started and we now have a different teacher, we have Mr Keen. In our first lesson with Mr Keen we were talking about boolean and how it is used in computers. Boolean is a method in which you use 1 and 0. We were also talking about bits and Bytes. In 8 bit there is 256 bytes, in 16 bit there is 65, 536 and in 32 bit there is 4, 294, 967, 296. 

I found the way you figure out how many byte in a bit was very confusing but i understood how to do boolean, and learnt that the on button for most computers is a 1 and 0.
